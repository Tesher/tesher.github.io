			<h2>About the group</h2>

		<h2>How we started</h2>
			<p class="sansserif">Bedwyn Footpaths Group was set up two and half years ago in the village of Great Bedwyn, by two enthusiastic users of the local rights of way, Judy and Tesher.  We have a broad membership, kids and grandparents, experienced walkers and amblers, we are especially keen to open up routes to members using mobility scoooters.</p>
			<h2>The past year</h2>
			<p class="sansserif">Judy plans the routes with the first challenge of getting the group to walk every single path in the parish.  This took a year.  There have been annual talks about the Brails and visits to archaeological digs in the ancient woods.  Treasure hunts at least twice a year with amazing prizes.  We always litter pick with the same enthusiasm.</p>
			<h2>Future plans</h2>
			<p class="sansserif">More of the same!  Thanks to the enthusiasm of our members we will keep meeting up and walking the rights of way, whilst keeping everyone informed about other ways to be invovled, via our website, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
