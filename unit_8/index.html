			<h2>About the group</h2>
			<p class="sansserif">We meet every month to walk the local rights of way - footpaths, bridleways and byways - in Great Bedwyn and neighbouring parishes.  It is our aim is to raise awareness of these public paths so as to keep them open and accessible for local people and visitors alike.</p>

		<h2>How we started</h2>
			<p class="sansserif">Bedwyn Footpaths Group was set up two and half years ago in the village of Great Bedwyn, by two enthusiastic users of the local rights of way.  We have a broad membership, kids and grandparents, experienced walkers and amblers, we are especially keen to open up routes to members using mobility scoooters.</p>

		<div id="right">
			<h2>The past year</h2>
			<p class="sansserif">The first challenge was getting the group to walk every single path in the parish.  This took a year.  There have been annual talks about the Brails and visits to archaeological digs in the ancient woods.  Treasure hunts at least twice a year with amazing prizes.  We always litter pick with the same enthusiasm.</p>
